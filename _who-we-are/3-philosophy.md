The Syariah Court has been the institution in settling disputes between divorcing parties. In relation to this, it has become the philosophy of the Syariah Court to strive for justice and to administer fairly and effectively the cases before it. This is in line with the following verses of the Quran :-

Allah's commandments in the Holy Quran,
![Allah's commandments in the Holy Quran](/images/arabic1b.gif)
"O ye who believe! Sound out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah can best protect both. Follow not the lusts of your hearts, lest ye swerve, and if ye distort justice or decline to do justice, verily Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do."

An-Nisa (The Women) 4 :135

Allah's commandment in the Holy Quran,
"And live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good."

An-Nisa (The Women) 4 : 19
